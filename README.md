# Visualizing Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Over Time

This data visualization tool was developed by Christian Rivera, Irshad Badarpura, and Abdul Wahhab. Our goal is to provide a method of comparing gene expression over time in single-cell RNA sequencing data. This project was completed at University of Illinois at Chicago as part of the Visual Data Science graduate course in Fall 2020. We designed this project in collaboration with Dr. Jalees Rehman, Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at University of Illinois at Chicago, through an activity-centered-design process, with particular emphasis on the functionality of the system, and with repeated feedback from our client, course staff, and classmates.
